# 10 RIGOROUS TEST FEEDBACKS FOR AI HACKATHON 2026
# Copy-paste these one by one into the feedback form

---

## FEEDBACK 1 - Mixed with constructive criticism
The speaker was incredibly knowledgeable and the technical depth was impressive. However, the presentation felt rushed in the second half and I couldn't keep up with the code examples on screen. Would have benefited from slower pacing and larger font size. Overall great content though!

---

## FEEDBACK 2 - Very negative with multiple issues
This was a complete waste of time. The speaker mumbled throughout, the slides were unreadable from the back, and the content was outdated. I've seen better presentations from junior developers. The Q&A session was also poorly managed with the speaker getting defensive when challenged. Would not recommend.

---

## FEEDBACK 3 - Short positive
Amazing session! Learned so much.

---

## FEEDBACK 4 - Detailed positive with specific praise
Outstanding presentation! The speaker had excellent command over the subject matter. The live coding demo was particularly impressive - no errors, smooth execution, and great explanations. The use of real-world examples made complex AI concepts very accessible. The interactive polls kept us engaged throughout. Best session of the conference!

---

## FEEDBACK 5 - Neutral with balance
The content was decent but nothing groundbreaking. Some parts were interesting, especially the case studies, but other sections dragged on. The speaker seemed knowledgeable but didn't engage much with the audience. It was an average experience - not bad, not exceptional.

---

## FEEDBACK 6 - Negative focused on delivery
The material itself was probably good, but I couldn't focus because of the speaker's monotone voice and lack of energy. They read directly from slides for 45 minutes straight. No eye contact, no interaction, no enthusiasm. Content needs better delivery.

---

## FEEDBACK 7 - Positive but with room for improvement
Really enjoyed the session! The speaker was charismatic and clearly passionate about the topic. My only suggestion would be to include more hands-on exercises - maybe a workshop format next time? The theory was solid but I wanted to actually build something. Still, would definitely attend again.

---

## FEEDBACK 8 - Technical negative with specifics
Several technical inaccuracies in the presentation. The explanation of transformer architectures was oversimplified to the point of being misleading. Also claimed that GPT-4 uses 500B parameters which is incorrect. These errors undermined credibility. Needs better fact-checking before presenting.

---

## FEEDBACK 9 - Emotional positive
This session literally changed my perspective on AI engineering! The speaker's passion was contagious and their story about getting into the field was so inspiring. I'm now motivated to pivot my career. Thank you for an unforgettable experience!

---

## FEEDBACK 10 - Constructive with specific suggestions
Good session overall with room for improvement. Suggestions: 1) Add timestamps to slides for reference later, 2) Share code snippets in GitHub beforehand, 3) Allow more time for Q&A (we only had 5 minutes), 4) Consider providing a resource list at the end. Content was valuable but logistics could be better.
